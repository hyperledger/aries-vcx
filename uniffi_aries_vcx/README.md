# UniFFI Aries VCX Proof Of Concept
This sub-directory contains the UniFFI wrappers and tools to generate Kotlin & Swift mobile wrappers over the `aries-vcx` crate.

## Core
Core contains a crate which wraps over the `aries-vcx` crate to provide a UniFFI-ready interface for wrapping. This crate's interface is what is used in `demos`.
