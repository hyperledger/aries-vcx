The repository contains
- Rust library `aries-vcx` implementing Aries protocols,
- collection of supporting projects.

## If you are Rust ðŸ¦€ developer
You can build your Rust project on top of
- [`aries-vcx`](aries_vcx) - ready to go Rust library to work with Aries protocols, both from
issuer/verifier's side or as a credential holder/prover.

Additionally, `aries-vcx` is built on top of smaller Rust crates which are part of this repo:
- [`messages`](messages) - crate for building and parsing Aries messages
- [`diddoc`](diddoc) - crate to work with DIDDocs

## If you are mobile ðŸ“± developer
Aries-vcx can be used to build native mobile applications. There are 2 approaches:
- **deprecated**: [`libvcx`](./libvcx) and its Java and Objective-C wrappers is complete, but deprecated
- **encouraged**, but in stage of POC: [`uniffi_aries_vcx`](./uniffi_aries_vcx) is next generation approach 
  to enable `aries-vcx` on mobile, providing Swift and Kotlin wrappers. However, this is yet in POC stage 
  and new adopters of `aries-vcx` on mobile are highly encouraged to contribute to its development.
