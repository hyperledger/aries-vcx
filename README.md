This is repository of
- Rust library `aries-vcx` implementing Aries protocols
- and collection of supporting projects

## If you are Rust ðŸ¦€ developer
You can build your Rust project on top of
- [`aries-vcx`](aries_vcx) - Ready to go Rust library to work with Aries protocols, both from
issuer/verifier side or credential holder/prover.

Additionally, Aries-vcx implementation is built on top of smaller Rust crates:
- [`messages`](messages) - crate for building and parsing Aries messages
- [`diddoc`](diddoc) - crate to work with DIDDocs

## If you are mobile ðŸ“± developer
Aries-vcx is well positioned for native Rust applications, however we are currently transitioning 
the recommended approach:
- deprecated, but battle-tested: `libvcx` and its Java and ObjectiveC wrappers is battle-tested but now deprecated approach.
- encouraged, but in stage of POC: `uniffi_vcx` is next generation approach to enable `aries-vcx` on mobile, providing Swift
and Kotlin wrappers. However, this is yet in POC stage and new adopters `aries-vcx` for mobile
are highly encourage to contribute to its development. 

Read more info about the transition and deprecation.
