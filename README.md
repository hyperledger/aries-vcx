The repository contains
- Rust library `aries-vcx` implementing Aries protocols,
- collection of supporting projects.

## If you are Rust ðŸ¦€ developer
You can build your Rust project on top of
- [`aries-vcx`](aries_vcx) - ready to go Rust library to work with Aries protocols for didcomm, VC issuance and verification.

Additionally, `aries-vcx` is built on top of smaller Rust crates which are part of this repo:
- [`aries_vcx_core`](aries_vcx_core) - foundational APIs to interact with ledger, wallet and anoncreds.
- [`messages`](messages) - crate for building and parsing Aries messages
- [`did_doc`](diddoc) - crate to work with DIDDocs 

## If you are mobile ðŸ“± developer
Aries-vcx can be used to build native mobile applications. You can write part of your mobile backend in Rust on top of
`aries-vcx` crate. Then expose FFI API for iOS/android environments.
- There's POC in progress [`uniffi_aries_vcx`](./uniffi_aries_vcx) using UniFFI library to autogenerate Swift and Kotlin wrappers.
