This is repository of
- Rust library `aries-vcx` implementing Aries protocols
- and collection of supporting projects

## If you are Rust ðŸ¦€ developer
You can build your Rust project on top of
- [`aries-vcx`](aries_vcx) - Ready to go Rust library to work with Aries protocols, both from
issuer/verifier side or credential holder/prover.

Additionally, Aries-vcx implementation is built on top of smaller Rust crates:
- [`messages`](messages) - crate for building and parsing Aries messages
- [`diddoc`](diddoc) - crate to work with DIDDocs

## If you are mobile ðŸ“± developer
Aries-vcx is well positioned for native mobile applications. There's to approaches one can take:
- **deprecated**: [`libvcx`](./libvcx) and its Java and Objective-C wrappers is complete but deprecated. It is not actively maintained and will be removed in the future.
- **encouraged**, but in stage of POC: [`uniffi_aries_vcx`](./uniffi_aries_vcx) is next generation approach to enable `aries-vcx` on mobile, providing Swift
and Kotlin wrappers. However, this is yet in POC stage and new adopters `aries-vcx` for mobile
are highly encourage to contribute to its development.
