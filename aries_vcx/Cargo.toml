# PATCH (TO MONITOR IN FUTURE): The following patch changes the `indy-data-types` (within indy-shared-rs) to depend on
# `ursa "0.3.6"` rather than `ursa "=0.3.6"`. Currently, `libvdrtools` depends on `ursa "0.3.7"`, which causes a mismatch of
# `indy-utils` versions, which causes some types within credx to fail. Details about the issue can be found here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-shared-rs/issues/20
# `indy-data-types` depends on `ursa =0.3.6` due to a 'broken cl feature', see commmit: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-shared-rs/commit/2403eed6449a3b5e347697b215a732fc33c014c0
# however using ursa 0.3.7 does not seem to affect our usage of indy-credx currently. More testing would be ideal.
# various combinations of indy-vdr and indy-credx have been tried to resolve the dependency mismatches, however this patch appears
# to be the only quick solution.
# Potential resolutions:
# - wait for ursa 0.3.8+ to resolve the CL issue and update indy-shared-rs,
# - monitor anoncred-rs (which will replace indy-credx) as the fix will likely go in here,
# - monitor the issue for other fixes from the maintainers: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-shared-rs/issues/20
# - update libvdrtools to use =0.3.6 ursa
