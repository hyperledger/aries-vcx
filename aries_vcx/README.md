# `aries_vcx` crate
Provides basic tools to build didcomm/aries enabled application in Rust. This can include native mobile apps, or 
webservers for VC issuance/verification, didcomm mediator service etc. 

#### What this crate can do for you
- Create encrypted wallet.
- Read/write from/to Indy ledger.
- Establish didcomm connections and exchange messages.
- Create and process Aries messages to drive Aries protocols (especially for VC issuance and presentation).

#### What does crate does NOT DO for you
- Provide message outbounds - `aries_vcx` helps you to create correct response & encrypt it, but you have to take care 
  of sending it to the right place.
- Automatic inbound processing - you have to take care of receiving messages and passing them to `aries_vcx` for processing.
  You need to keep track of your ongoing aries "conversations" and match incoming messages (typically based on message thread id).

# Getting started
To use `aries_vcx` in your project, you need to add GitHub dependency to your `Cargo.toml`, and best
define a version through a `tag`:
```toml
aries-vcx = { tag = "0.61.0", git = "https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx" }
```
It's also advisable to follow these [instructions](TUTORIAL.md) to check your environment is properly configured.

# Projects built with aries-vcx
- [mediator](../agents/rust/mediator) - Message mediator web service, useful for mobile device to receive messages while the device is offline.
- [unifii_aries_vcx](../uniffi_aries_vcx) - Mobile wrapper to autogenerate Swift and Kotlin wrappers. Also comes with sample native mobile app.
- [aries-vcx-agent](../agents/rust/aries-vcx-agent) - Sample agent framework adding persistence and message matching on top of `aries_vcx`. Used for cross-compatibility testing with other aries implementations.
