## How to contribute

You are encouraged to contribute to the repository by **forking and submitting a pull request**.

For significant changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes to avoid re-work.

(If you are new to GitHub, you might start with a [basic tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and check out a more detailed guide to [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).)

Pull requests will be evaluated by the repository guardians on a schedule and if deemed beneficial will be committed to the `main` branch. Pull requests should have a descriptive name and include an summary of all changes made in the pull request description, and include unit tests that provide good coverage of the feature or fix. A Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is executed on all PRs before review and contributors are expected to address all CI issues identified.

If you would like to propose a significant change, please open an issue first to discuss the work with the community.
