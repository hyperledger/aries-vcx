## How to contribute

You are encouraged to contribute to the repository by forking and submitting a pull request.

**For significant changes, get in touch with us first and let's discuss your idea together!**

(If you are new to GitHub, you might start with a [basic tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and check out a more detailed guide to [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).)

Pull requests will be evaluated by the repository guardians on a schedule and if deemed beneficial will be committed to the `main` branch. Pull requests should have a descriptive name and include an summary of all changes made in the pull request description, and include unit tests that provide good coverage of the feature or fix. A Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is executed on all PRs before review and contributors are expected to address all CI issues identified.

Contributions are made pursuant to the Developer's Certificate of Origin, available at [https://developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org), and licensed under the Apache License, version 2.0 (Apache-2.0).
