# Core UniFFI Aries VCX wrapper

This crate contains the proof of concept UniFFI wrapper over the `aries-vcx` crate. The wrapper's purpose is to very thinly wrap over the `aries-vcx` crate, to make it UniFFI-friendly.

# Scaffolding

Scaffolding is the rust code generated by UniFFI to create C-callable bindings to this crate. These bindings are automatically built by `build.rs`, targeting the `vcx.udl` file. These bindings are located in the `target` directory of the project/workspace and will show compiler errors if the `vcx.udl` interface does not integrate with this crate.

# Wrapper generation

Wrappers can be generated using the `uniffi-bindgen.rs` build script for kotlin and swift:

```
cargo run --features=uniffi/cli --bin uniffi-bindgen generate src/vcx.udl --language kotlin
```

```
cargo run --features=uniffi/cli --bin uniffi-bindgen generate src/vcx.udl --language swift
```
